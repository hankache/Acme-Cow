# An experimental AppVeyor config to install Strawberry Perl and
# Rakudo Star. Once installed, AppVeyor caches those for use next time.
#
# I specifically don't build Rakudo from GitHub because I want to use
# the "normal people" release.


# AppVeyor environment variables: https://www.appveyor.com/docs/environment-variables/

os: Visual Studio 2015

platform: x64

# clearing the cache: https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/985
# change .appveyor_clear_cache.txt to invalidate cache
#
# If the build is successful, AppVeyor caches these files and
# directories for future builds
cache:
    - C:\Strawberry -> .appveyor_clear_cache.txt
    - C:\Rakudo -> .appveyor_clear_cache.txt
